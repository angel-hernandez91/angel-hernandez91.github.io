				<p> Coding and Cats is my first website created in an effort to bring more cats to the internet, and to become slightly less terrible with HTML, CSS, and jQuery. Currently, the website is about two weeks in development, and more features are still being added. Support on mobile has not been fully enabled and not enough cats have been added.
				</p>

				<p> At the moment I'm currently working on getting the Blog and Code pages set up. There are jQuery transitions that are being added, along with more CSS formatting. I'm not entirely sure what this blog will contain yet, but most likely posts about projects, helpful python tutorials, and cat facts.
				</p>

				<p> The next big set will be adding support for mobile and will require resizing and changing layouts on certain pages for mobile compatibility. The main menu will also need some updates to look sleeker on mobile. Yay hamburger!. And of course, there are so many more pictures of Fry and Nibbler that need to added. They are precious, and we need so much more of them.
				</p>

			<h3 data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1000"> Mobile Cats - December 22, 2018 </h3>

				<p> So I'm back after several updates to Coding and Cats. The addition of mobile support has been completed. Now there are features like a hamburger menu, dynamic sizing of text, images, and the footer. There was a lot of trial and error in the process and there was quite a bit of code refactoring that needed to be done. I initially made the mistake of thinking about desktop only, and didn't even consider different desktop sizing. Thus, there were a lot of fixed margins, padding, and sizing that needed to be remediated.</p>

				<p>All that being said, I've learned that initially putting dynamic sizing and scaling first. This would have elimiated the need to refactor so much code, and would resulted in fewer bugs as changes were being made. Hidden fixed margins and widths can drastically alter a websites appearence on mobile and make it extremely difficult to fix. But that's all behind us now and we're functional.</p>

				<p>On mobile we have a hamburger menu and the CSS transitions used are part of the Mobirise bootstrap library. While Mobirise was not used to create this website, it does have a lot of useful generated code, but it does sacrifice a lot flexibility. I guess that's what you get for just using the free components on it. However, out of curiosity the next website I build will be done entirely on Mobirise. That is, unless I need some thing special, but I will try to use Mobirise as much as possible.</p>

				<p>Now what remains is adding more cat photos. Yes, there are new ones since the last post. Updating this blog. And lastly, updating the Code page with project details, documentation, and funny quips because a future employer would probably be into that. Is this good enough for Imgur? Remember me? Is this enough cats? </p>

			<div class="blog-post fade-out-dep" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-anchor-placement="bottom-bottom">
				<p>So 2018 was a wild ride. Both professionally and personally. Python skills definitely leveled up significantly to the point where I almost feel like an actual programmer. And I finally got around to making a decent website with all the trimmings. And not to mention I welcome Fry and Nibbler into my home. Adorable little, sneaky bastards.</p>

				<p>The last 2 weeks of 2018 were spent trying to wrap my head around deep learning. I've always been fascinated by the topic, but never got around to learning anything about it. And the times I did try, I would get lost in Python I didn't understand yet. But now, thanks to the Deep Learning A - Z Udemy course, medium articles, MIT lectures on YouTube, and many other resources, I've started to fiddle around with some basic Neural Nets. However, performance has been very medicore because this Macbook Air can't handle much, and my Dell isn't that much better. </p>

				<p>I'd really like to get into Kaggle competitions and see if anything comes out of that. I'm hoping that my competitive nature will drive me to really dig deep in Neural Nets. And eventually I'd like to get started on creating my own rig for training networks. The powerlifting problem that's posed on Kaggle definitely blends two of my biggests interests. And I'd really like get into text, music, and image generation with some RNNs / GNNs.</p>

				<p>Let's see what 2019 will bring. Hopefully fewer typos.</p>

				<p>After several weeks of developing small models on my laptop. I decided to scale up and build
				a system dedicated to running deep learning and machine learning models. My MacBook Air, while fancy looking,
				does not have the processing power to complete these models in a manner where I can evaluate and develop them further.
				Deep Fry still. This post is pending. I was sidtracked by my build. Currently, having issues with missing RAM. 
				UPDATE: RAM Issues fixed. Build working correctly. Need to overclock. </p>
