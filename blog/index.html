					Coding and Cats is my first website created in an effort to bring more cats to the internet, and to become slightly less terrible with HTML, CSS, and jQuery. The idea of creating a website had always floated around in my mind, but I never followed through all the way. There were several cuplrits at play, one of them being my ability to get distracted very easily by shiny new coding ideas, such as a <a id="bacs-link" href="https://pypi.org/project/databricksapi/" target="_blank"> Databricks REST API wrapper </a>. The other reasons included not knowing anything about web development, and not having a platform to eaily host it on. I was able to pick up HTML in a few minutes, but CSS and JavaScript were a little trickier. And without those, we just end up with an early 90s internet throwback. Just look at this first attempt:
				</p>

				<div class="blog-img-container fade-out-dep" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-anchor-placement="bottom-bottom">
					<img class="blog-img" src="../imgs/blog/corgi-site.png" alt="first website attempt">

				<p>Serious skills with that marquee tag.</p>

				<p class="fade-out-dep" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-anchor-placement="bottom-bottom">
					As you can see, I also have a thing for Corgi's. The only thing cool about this site, aside from the snow Corgi, was that it is hosted on my Raspberry Pi. At the time of writing this, it is open to the world, and you can actually navigate to it. However, there's no domain name tied to it because I have a dynamic IP, and I'm to cheap to pay for a service that lets me map it to a static name. I tired <a id="bacs-link" href="https://noip.com" target="_blank">No-Ip's </a> free service, but that requires me to log-in once an month and check a box to keep using a semi-customizable, free domain name. Frankly, that's too much work, but the fun part in it all was learning how to set up port forwarding and an Nginx web server in Linux.
				</p>

				<p class="fade-out-dep" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-anchor-placement="bottom-bottom">
					Eventually, I learned about <a id="bacs-link" href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank"> GitHub Pages</a> which let's you host a website on Git by maintaining all the code in a repository, and enabling a few options in the repo set-up. It was quick and simple, and it is how this website here is currently running. And as far as I can tell, just about everything is supported, with the exception of a database, but that is beyond what I need right now. Could I have done this a different way? Probably, but this felt like the most hands on, and would give a practical way of learning what I needed to know to build a website. 
				</p>

				<div class="blog-img-container fade-out-dep" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-anchor-placement="bottom-bottom">

					So now I have a platform, and I know some HTML. CSS I'm picking up by googling around when I want to format something a certain way. JavaScript is the same way, and since I'm only planning on using it for simple animations, the scope of what I need to know is fairly small. Googling around worked well for about an hour, but there were a lot of concepts I did not understand. This eventually led to finding a cool Web Development path on <a id="bacs-link" href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/web-development" target="_blank"> Code Academy </a> and signing up for it. Ultimately, it made a huge difference, and drastically improved the speed at which I was moving it. I'm still going through the course and starting to learn about more modern CSS principles like Grids and Flexbox.

				</div>

				<p class="fade-out-dep" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-anchor-placement="bottom-bottom"> 
					And while I did learn a alot from the course that improved my CSS skills, I also learned exactly what terms to use in my Google searches. Right now, I honestly prefer the more verbose, long ways of coding up my stylesheets just because it explictly says what parts I'm modifying and how. There are so many minor things to know, and what feels like 50 ways of doing the same thing. So in the end, I'm kind of left feeling like this:

				<p>
					Currently, the website is about two weeks into development, and more features are still being added. Many bugs are starting to emerge, often times a fix just leads to several other things breaking. Support on mobile has not been fully enabled, and it looks like it might be nightmare, but that might be my own fault for not knowing enough repsonsive design right now. Lastly, not enough cats have been added, and need to dig through hundreds of photos of Fry and Nibbler to find the most adorable ones. The photo on the main page was shot impromptu when Fry decided to sit by my laptop as I took a break from building my Databricks REST API wrapper. I seized the opportunity and decided to make that adorable sneaky bastard my main image.

				</div>

				<p class="fade-out-dep" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-anchor-placement="bottom-bottom"> 
					At the moment I'm currently working on getting the Blog and Code pages set up. There are jQuery transitions that are being added because Fade In and Fade Out are cool and totally unnecessary. There's a lot of CSS formatting that needs to be done and possibly some color palates that need to changed. Right now, I'm not entirely sure what this blog will contain yet, but most likely coding updates, posts about projects, helpful python tutorials, and cat facts.
				</p>

				<p class="fade-out-dep" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-anchor-placement="bottom-bottom"> 
					Aside from creating the rest of the Coding and Cats pages, the next big step will be adding support for mobile. Based on what I've done so far, I know that will require resizing and changing layouts on certain pages for mobile compatibility. Using media queries for certain aspects, and possibly introducing Bootstap to handle things like the Hamburger Menu. And of course, there are so many more pictures of Fry and Nibbler that need to added. They are precious, and we need so much more of them.

				Coding and Cats has seen a lot of updates over the past two weeks. There was definitely some struggle once I noticed the website on mobile had a lot of issues. Even as I am writing this I am finding small bugs here and there regarding sizing and layout. If had to do this all over again I would have definitely put mobile first design first. That being said, I'm very happy with how the website is currently coming along. Now there are features like a hamburger menu, dynamic sizing of text, images, and the footer.

				<p class="fade-out-dep" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-anchor-placement="bottom-bottom">
				Incorporating responsive design required a lot of research and careful consideration of how elements should be laid out. I became very familiar with media queries, which handle breakpoints thats could not be resolved using responsive design. The resume section in particular removes images when viewed on mobile. I made the decision to do this because on mobile the images would just look awkward and washout the the main elements of the resume.

				<p class="fade-out-dep" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-anchor-placement="bottom-bottom">Just compare this:</p>

				All that being said, there was a lot of code refactoring that needed be done. In some cases fixing one issue caused other issues down the line. I initially made the mistake of thinking about desktop only, and didn't even consider different desktop sizes, or other ways screen size could vary. Thus, there were a lot of fixed margins, padding, and sizing that needed to be remediated. The introduction of additional libraries caused name collisions in some cases and CSS styles were being overwritten. One such library was the <a id = "bacs-link" href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap </a> library, which is amazing for things like photo galleries and hamburger menus. However, it has a lot of elements that have <code> !important </code> tags, which made things frustrating. In addition, to all of these, there were also changes that were made at the global level which messed with my overall layout. Tracking them all down trying to find the different stylesheets that controlled things like the menu, footer, and list items proved to be tedious, but overall helped increase my understanding of CSS, improve my layout, and make everything flow more smoothly.

				</div>
				<p class="fade-out-dep" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-anchor-placement="bottom-bottom">
				Overall it was a fun experience to work with Bootstrap and to layout a website that looks great on both desktop and mobile. I definitely think that things could have been done much better and more elegantly, but regardless I'm happy with the way things turned out. Especially with my sub-menu inside of my hamburger menu, just look at this simple thing of beauty:

				</div>

				<p class="blog-img-container fade-out-dep" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-anchor-placement="bottom-bottom">
				If I'm being honest though, the code the generates that is kind of mess because I didn't like the Bootstrap defaults so I messed with the core library until I got what I wanted. The good thing about introducing this was that it forced me to rewrite the whole navigation menu, which ended up being much cleaner and didn't have any weird padding / sizing bugs. What helped the most with all of this was the Chrome Inspector because I could hightlight portions of the website and see what HTML and CSS scripts were affecting it. In addition, I could also see what was contributing to padding, margin, and borders, which really helped with cases where I unintentionally misaligned things by including padding where I didn't need any.

				<p class="fade-out-dep" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-anchor-placement="bottom-bottom">
				Now what remains is actually adding content to the website. Definitely a lot more cat photos because Nibbler and Fry are precious, precious fur babies. This blog is actually starting to come along, and I'm planning on updating some of the posts currently on here. They were created in a bit a hurry just to get an idea of what the blog would look like overall, and so I could write the HTML and CSS to make things look like this website wasn't a 90s relic. At the moment, the Code page is lacking. Aside from some high-level lists of projects I haven't added anything useful like "how-to" guides, documention, or images. That will be coming after the blog is cleaned up. For now, everything can be summarized like this:</p>

				It's the new year and looking back, 2018 was a really great year for me both professionally and personally. My growth at work has been outstanding and the scope of my new project has allowed to really expand the develop my programming skills to point where I feel like an actual programmer, and not some Stack Overflow script kiddie. However, there's the old Reddit saying, "Copying code from Stack Overflow $1/Hour. Knowing what code to copy from Stack Overflow $100,000/year". Work aside, I also got around to finally making my own website, an idea that I had tossed around for about year before finally taking the time to buckle down learn some HTML/CSS and start building. I also contributed to PyPi last year, and I am still actively updating the packages with new features and bug fixes. These best part of year though was moving out of my college apartment, and welcoming Fry and Nibbler into my and Ada's lives. Those adorable, sneaky bastards have made our lives infinitely better, even though Fry won't stop trying to destroy my plants.

				<p class="fade-out-dep" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-anchor-placement="bottom-bottom">
				Reflections aside, the last 2 weeks of 2018 were spent trying to wrap my head around Deep Learning. I've always been fascinated by the topic, but never really had the time to put into mastering it. The times I did try I would get lost in the Python syntax and libraries that I didn't had never used before like Numpy. However, sine I was able to really put a lot of hours into using and learning Python I was able to start focusing more on the concepts associated with Deep Learning, rather than trying to figure out what code this actually does:
				</p>
					<code  class="fade-out-dep" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-anchor-placement="bottom-bottom"> 
					{key: "Super Cool" for (key,value) in cool_animals.items() if cool_animals[key] == 'cats'} 
					</code>

				<p class="fade-out-dep" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-anchor-placement="bottom-bottom">
				I used quite a resources, but the most helpful where the <a id="bacs-link"> Deep Learning A - Z Udemy </a> course, MIT lectures on YouTube, and a lot of Medium articles like the following [include list]. I've started to fiddle around with some basic Neural Nets. However, performance has been very medicore because this Macbook Air can't handle much, and my Dell isn't that much better. </p>

				<p class="fade-out-dep" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-anchor-placement="bottom-bottom">
				I'd really like to get into Kaggle competitions and see if anything comes out of that. I'm hoping that my competitive nature will drive me to really dig deep in Neural Nets. And eventually I'd like to get started on creating my own rig for training networks. The powerlifting problem that's posed on Kaggle definitely blends two of my biggests interests. And I'd really like get into text, music, and image generation with some RNNs / GNNs.

				<p>After several weeks of developing small models on my laptop. I decided to scale up and build
				a system dedicated to running deep learning and machine learning models. My MacBook Air, while fancy looking,
				does not have the processing power to complete these models in a manner where I can evaluate and develop them further.
				Deep Fry still. This post is pending. I was sidtracked by my build. Currently, having issues with missing RAM. 
				UPDATE: RAM Issues fixed. Build working correctly. Need to overclock. </p>
