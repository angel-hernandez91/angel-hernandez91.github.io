				<p> My name is Angel Hernandez and I like to do beep boop on the computer. I am a Data Engineer at Beghou Consulting, where my work focuses primarly on developing data pipelines, unifying data analytics and ingestion, and Python / PySpark development for Beghou Consulting's cloud transition. </p>

				<p> As you can probably tell I love cats. They are God's perfect killing machines and I love that we've turned them into fur potatoes that we pick up, tease, and dress up. I have two of these adorable fur potatoes, Nibber and Fry, who were both adopted from <a id="bacs-link" href="http://friendsofbacs.org"> BACS </a> </p>

				<p> I have always been interested in Programming and Computer Science ever since I learned how load Space Invaders from an 8in Floppy Disk on early 90s MS-DOS machine when I was 8 years old. I have never been the best at it, but some how I've managed to make a living from it. Outside of work I like to spend my time goofing around on different projects ranging from a Raspberry Pi Home Server to creating Python packages for PyPi. Recently, I have decided to dabble in a little Web Development after several work related projects that utilized Flask and Dash by Plotly. And so as a result, we now have Coding and Cats!
				</p>

				<p> Life is more than just beep boop. I am also a Powerlifer (S:475/B:315/D:505) -- check out my Instagram linked in at the bottom of the page. I enjoy shooting despite being a liberal hippe. I volunteer at Berkeley Animal Care Services (BACS) and make sure all the dogs and cats get the pats and nose boops they so rightfully deserve. Lastly, I have a girlfriend and we spend our time fancy eating, fancy drinking, being endlessly entertained by our cats, and trying get 3 stars on every Overcooked 2 level.
